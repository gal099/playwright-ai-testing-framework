## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **`/setup` Command - Automated Project Initialization**: `.claude/commands-user/setup.md`
  - **Purpose**: Fully automated first-time setup for new users starting with the framework
  - **Features**:
    - Converts framework to Template Mode (removes CLAUDE-DEV.md, framework dev files)
    - Installs all dependencies (`npm install`)
    - Creates `.env` file from `.env.example`
    - Completely cleans git history (`rm -rf .git`, `git init`)
    - Creates initial commit with fresh history
    - Runs health check (`npm test tests/examples/`)
    - Guides user through remote repository setup (GitHub CLI or manual)
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Zero manual steps** - One command does everything
    - **Safe defaults** - Tested workflow from clone to first test
    - **Clear guidance** - Step-by-step post-setup instructions
    - **Fresh start** - Clean git history for user's project
  - **Cost**: No AI costs (pure bash automation)
  - **Status**: Fully tested in isolated environment

- **`/context` Command - Quick Project State Overview**: `.claude/commands-user/context.md`
  - **Purpose**: Help returning users quickly understand current project state
  - **Features**:
    - Reads project documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, package.json)
    - Shows git status and recent commits (last 10)
    - Lists existing test areas (tests/) and helpers (utils/api/)
    - Displays all available branches
    - Provides available commands reference
    - Shows quick start guide
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Fast onboarding** - Get up to speed in seconds
    - **Read-only** - No file modifications or setup operations
    - **Comprehensive** - All context in one place
    - **Safe** - Cannot break anything, just reads state
  - **Cost**: No AI costs (pure information gathering)
  - **Use Cases**: Returning after break, new team member orientation, project overview

- **Automatic Selector Extraction for /new-screen**: Implemented ENHANCE-008 - Made /new-screen fully automatic
  - **Core Implementation**: `utils/ai-helpers/selector-extractor.ts` (408 lines)
    - `SelectorExtractor` class with AI vision-powered selector extraction
    - `extractSelectors(url, pageType, options)` method
    - Returns structured result: selectors, redirectUrl, errorSelectors, timing, confidence score
  - **Features**:
    - Automatic screenshot capture from APP_URL
    - DOM structure extraction (buttons, inputs, links, forms, textareas)
    - AI vision analysis using Sonnet model for high accuracy
    - Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) based on selector stability
    - Timing detection (load/networkidle/domcontentloaded)
    - Async operation detection
    - Graceful error handling and validation
  - **Model**: Sonnet (AI vision required for screenshot analysis)
  - **Cost**: ~$0.05-0.10 per page extraction
    - Input: ~3000 tokens (screenshot base64 + DOM structure JSON)
    - Output: ~500 tokens (JSON with selectors and metadata)
  - **Selector Priority**:
    1. `[data-testid="..."]` (most stable)
    2. `[name="..."]` (for inputs)
    3. `[aria-label="..."]` or `[role="..."]` (accessibility)
    4. `button:has-text("...")` (unique text)
    5. CSS selectors (last resort)
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Saves 5-10 minutes per screen** (95% time reduction)
    - No manual codegen exploration needed
    - Generates helper-ready selector code automatically
    - Provides timing and async operation guidance
    - Quality assessment via confidence score
    - Falls back to manual codegen if extraction fails

### Changed

- **`/new-screen` Command - Phase 1 Redesign**: `.claude/commands-user/new-screen.md`
  - **Before**: Manual codegen exploration workflow (user had to explore UI, copy selectors, report back)
  - **After**: Fully automatic AI vision analysis
    - Automatically captures screenshot from APP_URL
    - Extracts selectors using SelectorExtractor utility
    - Shows identified elements to user for validation
    - Falls back to manual codegen if automatic extraction fails
  - **User Experience**:
    - Before: 5-10 minutes of manual work
    - After: ~30 seconds, fully automatic (just run command and approve)
  - **Cost Trade-off**: +$0.08 per screen for massive time savings (worth it!)

### Documentation

- TypeScript compilation successful
- No regressions detected

**Impact:** Major UX improvement for /new-screen command. Saves significant time (5-10 min → 30 sec) with small AI cost increase ($0.08). Backwards compatible - can fall back to manual codegen if needed.

  - CLAUDE.md: Terminology clarified (framework vs template context)
  - GETTING-STARTED.md: Updated to reflect framework nature

### Added

- **Git & Review Protocol**: Mandatory review process before pushing (ENHANCE-003)
  - CLAUDE-DEV.md: New "Git & Review Protocol (MANDATORY)" section
  - Step-by-step checklist before pushing to remote
  - Mandatory `/review-changes` before commits to main
  - Framework commands updated with review step (improve-framework, fix-framework)

- **TODO_template.md**: Now tracked in git for framework development
  - Previously ignored, now visible for team collaboration
  - Tracks framework improvements, bugs, and enhancements
  - Updated ENHANCE-003 status to implemented

- **Test Case Planner Feature**: Added to README.md feature list

- All documentation now consistently uses "framework" for source, "template" for generated output

**Breaking Changes**: Repository URL changed, but GitHub redirects handle this automatically. Users cloning the old URL will be redirected to the new one.

**Migration**: No action needed for existing users. Git remotes will work automatically via GitHub redirect, but can be updated manually:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:gal099/playwright-ai-testing-framework.git
```

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- **AI Model Versions**: Updated to Claude 4.5 series to fix 404 errors
  - Updated Sonnet: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
  - Updated Opus: `claude-3-opus-20240229` → `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`
  - Kept Haiku: `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (latest stable)
  - Location: `config/ai-client.ts`
  - Documentation: Updated `docs/AI-MODEL-STRATEGY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.example`
  - Resolves: AI feature tests failing with "model not found" errors
  - Testing: All models validated and working correctly

**Impact:** This fixes the pre-existing issue where AI-powered features (self-healing selectors, AI assertions, test generation, test case planning) were failing with 404 errors due to deprecated model versions. All AI features now use the latest Claude 4.5 models.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- **Test Case Planner**: AI-powered feature to generate manual test case documentation from screenshots
  - New command: `npm run ai:plan-tests <url-or-screenshot> <screen-name>`

    - Test case IDs (TC-XX-001, TC-XX-002, etc.)
    - Priorities (P1/P2/P3) based on criticality and risk
    - Preconditions, steps, and expected results
    - Automation recommendations
    - Summary with breakdown by priority
  - Output: `docs/{SCREEN}-TEST-CASES.md` in Markdown format
  - Model: Sonnet (~$0.05-0.15 per analysis)

**Use Case:** Generate comprehensive test documentation BEFORE automation. Ideal for:
- Identifying all test scenarios without logging into systems
- Planning and prioritizing test coverage with team
- Reviewing test cases before writing automation code
- Deciding which tests to automate (P1) vs. document (P2/P3)
- Faster test planning than manual documentation

**Workflow Integration:**
1. Generate test docs: `npm run ai:plan-tests http://localhost:3000/login login`
2. Review and adjust priorities with team
3. Automate P1 tests: `/new-screen login`
4. Keep P2/P3 tests documented for future implementation

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive test coverage identification
- Better prioritization before coding
- Team collaboration on test strategy
- Reduced waste (only automate critical tests)
- Faster than manual test case writing
